## This website is my first website i've ever made, and I learned a whole lot about HTML and CSS in the process. In the process for creating this website, I had done personal branding in the past so I mainly wanted to update that branding slightly, give it a fresh coat of paint. I wouldn't say that this brand is something that I have been working on for a while but it was fun to take what I already had and create something new from it. I decided to use Gasoeck One as my chosen font because I like how its a curved geometric font. It was pleasing to the eye and i've used it in projects in the past. I would say that the thing that makes my project stand out the most is the background for sure, it creates an interesting contrast between the simplicity of the business card and then the more complex look of the background. I addressed accesibility by running my color palettes and website through accesibility checks along the way as well as writing alt text for all of my image assets. I guess this site solves the problem of me not having a business card? I'm not really sure about that one honestly. 

## I had a lot of fun with this project and it's made me realize that I like coding kind of? Don't get me wrong, it's super annoying, but it's also kind of relaxing when you get into that flow state. Overall, I never expected to enjoy coding this much, but i've had a blast with this project.
